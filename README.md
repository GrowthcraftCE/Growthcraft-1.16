Welcome to Growthcraft. Growthcraft is a collection of Minecraft mods that adds an extra layer of immersion into the
world of Minecraft. Growthcraft adds the ability to grow Apple tress, collect honey from bees, grow hops and grapes on
vines that will crawl along rope. You can make cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter, rice for a flavorfull meal.
Additionally, you can make Ale, Wine, Juice, Ciders, kumis, and sake and make it extra potent for a stronger affect.

## Getting Started

There are multiple starting points to Growthcraft. As we continue to re-invent Growthcraft, we will be adding to our
GitHub wiki documentation.

## History

### Growthcraft 6 (Minecraft 1.16)

End of Support: TBD Latest Version: 6.0.11 Stable Version: TBD

Going from Minecraft Forge 1.12 to 1.16 made a lot of changes to the MCP mappings to the point that it prompted a
complete rewrite from the ground. We are expecting to have a stable release in a few days.

End of Support: 25 MAR 2018  
Latest Version: 3.0.0  
Stable Version: NEVER RELEASED

Mojang rapidly released Mincraft 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, and then everyone thought that 1.11 was going to become the long term
support version. Before we were able to release it, Minecraft 1.12.2 was released as long term support and made
Growthcraft 3 obsolete. A stable version of Growthcraft 3 was never released.

Growthcraft 2 was a major re-release of Gwafu's original work. In 2015, the Growthcraft
"Community Edition" Team was given permission to take over the mod development.

In this version, we added village structures. We added two additional sub-muodules, Growthcraft Milk and Rice. These new
mods added, Cheese, yogurt, ice cream, Sake, Rice, rice and thistle crops. When we first rolled out the thistle crop, it
was k nown to wildly grow and take over entire worlds.

### Growthcraft 1 (Minecraft 1.7.2)

End of Support: 13 JUL 2014  
Latest Version: 2.1.0a  
Stable Version: 2.1.0a

The original Growthcraft mod was created and developed by Gwafu. He did a lot of improving it over a period of three
years.
